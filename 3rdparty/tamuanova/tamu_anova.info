1 Introduction
**************

ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a method for comparing levels of
some continuous response variable between different groups.  The main
idea is to compare variation within each group to variation between the
groups; if the groups vary considerably from one group to another in
comparison to the within group variation, we can reject the null
hypothesis that all the groups have similar levels of the response
variable.

   TAMU ANOVA contains both single and two factor ANOVA.  Use of the
package can be facilitated through linking to the compiled library
tamuanova.  The package function definitions are accessible through
`tamu_anova.h'.  Another option for use of the package is to include
the original function definitions in the files `anova_1.h' and
`anova_2.h'.  With the use of these files the program must still be
linked to the GSL (see GSL documentation on linking and compiling.)

2 Motivation
************

The first reason for creating this package was that, to the best of the
programmers' knowledge, there was not an open source package in
existence that computed sums of squares correctly in the case of
unequal cell sizes.  The model for the two-way ANOVA is commonly y_ijk
= \alpha_i + \beta_j + \gammaij + \epsilon_ijk, but the sums of squares
are computed in different ways according to the hypotheses desired to
test.  This package computes Type III sums of squares, as described in
Searle (1987).  The Type III Sums of Squares are the only correct sums
of squares in the case of unequal cell sizes (but no cells are empty)
when the desired hypotheses are as follows: H_o: \alpha_1 = \alpha_2 =
... = \alpha_k = 0 vs. H_a: at least one \alpha_i \neq 0, H_o: \beta_1
= \beta_2 = ... = \beta_m = 0 vs. H_a: at least one \beta_i \neq 0,
and H_o: \gamma_1,1 = \gamma_1,2 = ... = \gamma_k,m vs. H_a: at  least
one \gamma_i,j = 0.

   The second reason for creating this package was to calculate
F-statistics for models with random and mixed effects as described in
Section 4.10 of Sahai and Ageel's book, The Analysis of Variance
(2000).  Some packages seem superficially to calculate F-statistics
correctly, but upon further investigation, do not actually find the
F-statistics recommended by Sahai and Ageel(2000).

3 Computational Method
**********************

The one-way ANOVA tables were computed by the methods described in
Devore (2004).  First, sums of squares are computed in the usual way (n
is the total number of observations, and k is the number of populations
in the study): 	SST = \sum_i=1^k \sum_j=1^n_i (x_ij -
\barx_..)^2,         SSM = \sum_i=1^k \sum_j=1^n_i (\barx_i. -
\barx_..)^2, and         SSE = \sum_i=1^k \sum_j=1^n_i (x_ij -
\barx_i.)^2.  Then the package constructs the ANOVA table as follows:

Source:     SS:     df:     MS:            F-stat:        p-value:
Model       SSM     k-1     SSM/k-1        SSM/SSE        P(F > F-stat)
Error       SSE     n-k     SSE/n-k                       
Total       SST     n-1     SST/n-1                       

   The two-way models require further computation when the desired
hypotheses to be tested are not conditional on the previous factors
entered into the model but are the most common (where the model is:
y_ijk = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \gamma_ij + \epsilon_ijk):     H_o:
\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = ... = \alpha_k = 0,     H_o:  \beta_1 = \beta_2 =
... = \beta_m = 0, and     H_o:  \gamma_11 = \gamma_12 = ... =
\gamma_km = 0.  Note that the hypotheses for the individual factors
only hold in the absence of significant interaction.

   Following Searle (1987), then, the package computes Type III Sums of
Squares:     SST = \sum_i n_i. \bary_i..^2 + \sum_j=1^b-1 \mathaccent
94 \tau_j r_j,  where for     c_jj = n_.j - \sum_i=1^a n_ij^2/n_i.,
c_jj' = -\sum_i=1^a n_ijn_ij'/n_i., and     r_j = y_.j. - \sum_i=1^a
n_ij \bary_i.., we solve the b-1 linear equations     c_jj \mathaccent
94 \tau_j + \sum_j'=1, j' \neq j^b-1 c_jj' \mathaccent 94 \tau_j' = r_j
for \mathaccent 94 \tau_1, \mathaccent 94 \tau_2,..., \mathaccent 94
\tau_b-1.  These computations are only correct in the case that no
cells are empty.   In the case that some cells are completely empty,
the experimenter must use other  methods to compute sums of squares,
depending on the desired hypotheses.

   Those methods only are appropriate in the case that the effects are
fixed.  In the case that the effects are random, the expected values of
the mean squares are not the same as for the fixed case, so one uses a
different denominator for finding the F-statistics in the ANOVA table.
The computation follows the recommendation of Sahai and Ageel (2000):

   For the random effects model,     F_\alpha = MS_\alpha / MS_\gamma
and 		F_\beta = MS_\beta / MS_\gamma.

   For the mixed effects model,     F_\alpha = MS_\alpha / MS_\gamma and
F_\beta = MS_\beta / MSE.

   Thus we see that for the mixed effects model, the data must be
entered in such a way that the first effect is the fixed effect, while
the second effect is the random effect.

4.2 Function Definitions
========================

 -- Function: tamu_anova_table tamu_anova (double DATA[],long FACTOR[],
          long I, long J);
This performs the one way ANOVA and returns a oneway table struct. The
arguments are as follows:
  1. data - an array of all data values of type double.

  2. factor - an array of factor codings for the data.  Acceptable
     values are 1..J with no breaks (I.E. the function does not allow
     for empty cells).

  3. I - the length of the data and factor arrays (yes they must be the
     same length).

  4. J - The number or factors in the experiment.

 -- Function: tamu_anova_table_twoway tamu_anova_twoway (double
          DATA[],long FACTOR[][2], long I, long J[2], enum
          gsl_anova_twoway_types TYPE )
   This performs the two way ANOVA and returns a twoway table struct.
The arguments are as follows:
  1. data - an array of all data values of type double.

  2. factor - a I x 2 matrix of type long for factor codings.
     Essentially an array of ordered pair of the type {factor A, Factor
     B}.  Acceptable values for are 1..J_A for factor A and 1..J_B for
     factor B.  With no skipped numbers (I.E. the function does not
     allow for empty cells)

  3. I - the length of the data and factor arrays (yes they must be the
     same length).

  4. J - an array of {J_A,J_B} which tells the function the number of
     groups for factor A and factor B.

  5. type - an enumerated variable to tell the function what kind of
     model to use.  This only affects the F and P values.

5 Examples
**********

Here are three examples of how to use the program.  They all assume
that you have the library installed and are able to link to it without
any extra declarations.  If this is not the case extra compiler
directive may be needed to compile and link properly.
WARNING: The TAMU ANOVA library must be linked with the GSl libraries,
as shown in the examples.  The functions in TAMU ANOVA use the gsl and
cannot be ran without it.
Example 1: One-way balanced ANOVA
     #include <tamu_anova/tamu_anova.h>
     //Data set from Devore(2004).
     double data[20] = {
     88.60,73.20,91.40,68.00,75.20,63.00,53.90,69.20,
     50.10,71.50,44.90,59.50,40.20,56.30,38.70,31.00,
     39.60,45.30,25.20,22.70 };
     long factor[20]={
     1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4 };

     int main()
     {
     	struct tamu_anova_table tbl1 = tamu_anova(data,factor,20,4);
     	tamu_anova_printtable(tbl1);
     	return 0;
     };
   This file would be compiled by the following:

     % gcc -c testfile.c
     % gcc testfile.o -ltamuanova -lgsl -lgslcbls -lm

Example(2): One-way unbalanced ANOVA
     #include <tamu_anova/tamu_anova.h>
     //Data from Devore(2004)
     double data[22] = {
     45.50,45.30,45.40,44.40,44.60,43.90,44.60,44.00,44.20,
     43.90,44.70,44.20,44.00,43.80,44.60,43.10,46.00,45.90,
     44.80,46.20,45.10,45.50
     };
     long factor[22]={
     1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3
     };
     int main()
     {
     struct tamu_anova_table tbl1 = tamu_anova(data,factor,22,3);
     tamu_anova_printtable(tbl1);
     return 0;};
   this example is compiled the same as above
An example of two way unbalanced ANOVA with data from Searle(1987).
     #include <tamu_anova/tamu_anova.h>

     double d[15]={
     6,10,11,13,15,14,22,12,15,19,18,31,18,9,12};
     long f[15][2]={
     {1,1},
     {1,1},
     {1,1},
     {1,2},
     {1,2},
     {1,3},{1,3},
     {2,1},{2,1},{2,1},{2,1}
     ,{2,2},
     {2,3},{2,3},{2,3}};

     int main()
     {
     struct tamu_anova_table_twoway r;
     long J[2]={2,3};
     r=tamu_anova_twoway(d,f,15,J,0);
     tamu_anova_printtable_twoway(r);
     };
   This is compiled the same as above for the one way library linked
example.  The output is (slightly reformatted from what is printed on
the screen):

Source: SS:          df:     MS:            F-stat:        p-value:
Factor-A123.771429   1       123.771429     9.282857       0.013865

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify
       this document under the terms of the GNU Free
       Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version
       published by the Free Software Foundation; with no
       Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
       Back-Cover Texts.  A copy of the license is included in
       the section entitled ``GNU Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR
       TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and
       with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
