TAMU ANOVA NEWS

Version 0.2.1 released
-------------------------
A memory leak in anova_2.c was fixed.


TAMU ANOVA 0.2 released
-------------------------
I have made a few changes and improvements that warents a new release.
The changes are:
	-Improved error handling
	 TAMU ANOVA now uses the GSL error handler for errors.
	-File structure change
	 the file structure was changed to disallow direct inclusion of the 
	 functions. They must now be accesed only through the library.
	-Interface changes
	 Function names have been chaged.  All function begining with
	 gsl_tamu_anova have been changed to read tamu_anova so as to
	 not be confused with core gsl fucntions.
	-Computation changes
	 some slight computation changes were made to avoid cancelation error
	 

TAMU ANOVA 0.1 launched
-----------------------
It's finally here an open source GSL compliant package that 
will compute ANOVA.  At Texas A&M University, three statistics
students, Andrew Redd, Krista Rister, and Elizabeth Young, have 
programed and released TAMU ANOVA a gsl package for ANOVA.

The package computes both one and two way models, and can handle 
both balanced and unbalanced data.
